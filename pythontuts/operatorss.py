# Operators in python
# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment operators
# Comparison operators
# Logical operators
# Identity operators
# Membership operators
# Bitwise operators

#Arithmetic operators
# print("5+6=",5+6)
# print("5-6=",5-6)
# print("5*6=",5*6)
# print("5**3=",5**3)
# print("5/6=",5/6)
# print("15//6=",15//6)
# print("5%5=",5%5)

#Assignment operators
# x=5
# print(x)
# x%=7 #x=x+7
# print(x)

#Comparison operators-  <,>,<=,>=,!=,==
# i=8
# print(i!=5)

#Logical operators
# a=True
# b=False
# print(a and a)
# print(a and b)
# print(a or b)
# print(a or a)

# Identity operators
# a=True
# b=False
# print(a is not b)

#Membership operators
# list=[3,44,67,3,8,0,65,87,0]
# print(32 in list)
# print(32 not in list)
# print(87 in list)

#Bitwise operator
print(0 & 1)
print(0 & 2)
print(0 | 1)
print(0 | 3)
